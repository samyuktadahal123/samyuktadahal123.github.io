    <p id="paragraph_description"> Hi there! My name is Samyukta Dahal. I'm an international student studying Computer Science as a major at Weber State University. I'm basically a beginner with very less or basic knowledge in computer science. This is my 3rd semester. I always had a strong interest in learning coding and networking since childhood. That's the reason i'm studying this major now. My goal for this class is to learn something new and become more familiar with programming languages.</p>
